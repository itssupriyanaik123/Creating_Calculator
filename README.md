An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, 
especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom.

Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. 
They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that
decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and 
calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated
address book and dictionary devices.
